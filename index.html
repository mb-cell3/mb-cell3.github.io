    <p>Exposing yourself to the sun or to temperatures higher than 25C degrees DOES NOT prevent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
      You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is. Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19.
       To protect yourself, make sure you clean your hands frequently and thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.  </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Corona Virus can be transmitted through mosquitos </h2>
    <p>Till date there has been no evidence to suggest that corona virus can be transmitted through mosquitos. The new virus is a respiratory virus which
      spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.
     To protect yourself clean your hands regularly with alcohol based hand-rub or wash them with soap and water. </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Vitamin C can prevent catching COVID-19 virus </h2>
    <p>There is some evidence to suggest that vitamin C can protect you from certain viral infections, such as the influenza or rhinoviruses—the
       predominant cause of the common cold—but not the COVID-19 virus. The novel coronavirus and the influenza virus are quite different. 
       A person who regularly consumes fruits stand a much better chance of protection from infections than those who do not, even while they are, in general,
        healthy.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">The new coronavirus was deliberately created or released by people </h2>
    <p>Since early January, conspiracy theorists have been spreading the word that the novel coronavirus outbreak is a bioweapon, engineered by humans 
      and released, either deliberately or accidentally to the public to wreak havoc on global economies and politics. This claim was supported by the
       fact that Wuhan, China, the first known location from which the virus was transmitted from an animal to humans, is close to the Wuhan Institute 
       of Virology, whose labs study the world’s deadliest viruses. The belief became widespread enough to cause many, including some world leaders, 
       to dub the pathogen as a “Chinese virus” or the “Wuhan virus”</p>
